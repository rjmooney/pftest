.Sh NAME
.Nm pftest
.Nd test a packet filter rule set
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pftest
.Op Fl qx
.Fl R Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides an interface to test a packet filter rule set without
having to first commit the rules to active use in the filter.
.Pp
.Nm
reads simulated packet rules from 
.Pa stdin ,
which are subsequently tested against the filter rules specified in 
.Pa file .
The utility also accepts a limited number of commands when reading
input from
.Pa stdin .
.Pp
Once a simulated packet has been interpreted, the would-be action of
the packet filter is displayed.  Currently, this is "pass" or "drop".
.Pp
The command-line options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl q
Quiet mode. Suppress the the initialization banner.
.It Fl R Ar file
Load the specified rule file into the interpreter.
.It Fl x
Turn debugging on.
.El
.Pp
The interpreter commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar show
Display the filter rules being tested.
.It Ar help
Help menu.
.It Ar quit
Exit the interpreter.
.Sh GRAMMAR
.Pp
Packets are simulated via the following format:
.Pp
in|out on
.Pa if
[tcp|udp|icmp|icmp6] 
.Pa source[,port] dest[,port] 
[FSRPAU | icmp-type
.Pa type
[ icmp-code
.Pa code 
]]
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following sample commands can be entered directly into the
interpreter. The interpreter will respond with the would-be action
of the packet filter after each entry.
.Bd -literal
# an attempt to connect to the mail server
in on fxp0 tcp 10.0.0.1,38392 10.1.2.3,smtp S

# part 2 of a tcp setup
out on xl1 tcp fe80::290:27f:fe93:cc8b,www fe80::290:27f:fe93:cc8c,5050 SA

# ping from a host on the outside 
in on ep0 icmp 192.168.0.1 10.1.2.3 icmp-type echoreq
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/pf.conf" -compact
.It Pa /etc/pf.conf
Packet filter rules file.
.El

.Sh AUTHORS
Robert Mooney (rjmooney@aboveground.cx).  Daniel Hartmeier (dhartmei@openbsd.org)
authored the pf mechanism; it was key in the creation of this program.
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
relies on its own rule processing code, copied (almost verbatim) from the pf
kernel code.  Ideally,
.Nm
would rely on the pf kernel code to determine the fate of a simulated packet.
  
There are probably others.
